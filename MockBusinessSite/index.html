                <h3>High-Quality Pick-Me-Ups, Every Time</h3>
                <p>Our roasters and baristas strive to create the best drinks possible, every step of the way. From inspecting our green beans, to roasting them to the perfection, to grinding them fresh for every shot of espresso. Our staff have all been specially-trained in the art of <em>coffee mixology</em> and are all prepared to deliver whatever your heart desires <span class="shrink">(within reason, of course)!</span></p>
                <h3>Intuitive, Helpful Staff</h3>
                <p>Every barista and staff member understands our menu inside and out, and they're all here to help you navigate to your new favorite beverage. Whether it be something green <span class="shrink">(rose-infused matcha with coconut milk, on ice?)</span> or a classic, deep-brown cuppa joe <span class="shrink">(you can't go wrong with a classic)</span>. If you're ever unsure, we love playing 20-Questions to tune in and help you to leave happy!</p> 
                <h3>A Family-Friendly Environment</h3>
                <p>We understand that many of our customers are juggling youngsters and teens, alike. All are welcome at Cafe Promise, and we're happy to accomodate kiddos of all ages with pleasantries like <span class="grow">board games, playing cards, </span> and <span class="grow">less-mess arts-and-crafts</span>, so bring the whole family and relax, knowing there's something for everyone!</p>
