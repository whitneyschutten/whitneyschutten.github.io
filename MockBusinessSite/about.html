                <h2>How it all Started</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="section-text">
                <p>Have you ever been out and about, wandered by a cafe and thought to yourself, <em>"I could use a drink, why not?"</em> Then, to your dismay, what you received was not up to par with your standards? Or the customer service ruined the entire experience for you? I'd like to think we've all been there... and most of us, here at Cafe Promise have certainly been there more than we'd like to admit!<br></p>

                <p>Well, we started a mission to prevent that from happening <span class="shrink">(at least on our block!)</span>, and one small step at a time, Cafe Promise was born! It started with a small group of baristas who wanted to offer something <em>better</em> than what was available, in any way we could. This meant starting small <span class="shrink">(think farmer's markets)</span>, but our popularity quickly grew!<br></p> 

                <p>Over time, we built up the network and resources to lease our very own space, then, through lots of love and elbow-grease, beautified it and prepared it for the masses! Years have passed and the love in our little business has only grown! We're passionate about the drink-business, and we're passionate about maintaining a safe, happy, and tolerant space!<br></p>

                <p>We firmly believe that it's <em>this</em> set of values that sets us apart from the big coorporate shops. We focus on the small and local, on the <em>people,</em> rather than just the numbers. We hope you feel the difference, too, and return time and time again to take a break from the outside world with us. We promise to keep our values the same as the days go on. Welcome, friends!</p>
